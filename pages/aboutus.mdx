Objective

The Creative Electronics Alumni-Advisor Group (CEAG) was founded with the objective of providing a sense of belonging to members of the Creative Electronics Club (CEC) after they graduated from Chung Ling Private High School.

Furthermore, it enables alumni to stay in touch and maintain their relationship. This network also allows alumni to share information and assist one another.

CEAG was created to provide a platform for alumni to give back to the Creative Electronics Club by assisting CEC in event planning, teaching CEC members additional knowledge, assisting in course design, and so on.
